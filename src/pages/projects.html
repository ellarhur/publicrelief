          Gaza: Urgent Relief for a Trapped Population After over 19 months
          of intense conflict between Israel and Hamas, the humanitarian
          situation in Gaza is dire. More than 54,000 people have lost their
          lives, and over 124,000 have been injured. The UN now calls Gaza "the
          most hunger-stricken region on Earth." Public Relief supports several
          vetted organizations delivering critical, non-partisan aid: Doctors
          Without Borders (MSF): Operating field hospitals and mobile clinics
          that provide surgical care, maternal health services, child
          healthcare, and mental health support.<br /><br />
          Sudan: Local Heroes in a Forgotten War Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart
          by a brutal civil war between government forces and paramilitary
          groups. While the crisis has received limited media attention, its
          human toll is staggering. Millions have been displaced, and the
          healthcare and food systems have collapsed. We support Emergency
          Response Rooms (ERRs) — grassroots volunteer networks born out of the
          2019 revolution, now providing vital aid in cities and towns across
          Sudan.

          Ukraine: Recovery and  Relief in a War Zone. Two years into the war, Ukraine continues to face
          widespread devastation — from destroyed hospitals and homes to deeply
          traumatized communities. Public Relief is proud to support the
          country's humanitarian and recovery efforts. We fund initiatives
          through: United24: Ukraine’s official fundraising platform supporting
          the reconstruction of bridges, schools, and hospitals, and equipping
          ambulances and trauma care units.
