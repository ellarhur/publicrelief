        <h2>About Public Relief</h2>
        <p>
          In a society where many things feel uncertain, we wanted to be the
          difference. While headlines shift daily and trust in institutions
          continues to erode, one thing should always remain reliable: that your
          help truly helps. That’s why we started Public Relief — an
          independent, transparent donation platform built on one simple idea:
          people deserve to know where their money goes. Every time someone
          donates through Public Relief, their contribution is tracked from
          start to finish. Whether it’s going toward emergency food supplies in
          drought-stricken regions, rebuilding schools after natural disasters,
          or supporting mental health services for war survivors, we document
          and report every step of the journey. You’ll get a personal impact
          report with photos, GPS coordinates, receipts, and testimonials from
          people on the ground. That’s what we mean by radical transparency. We
          partner only with vetted, community-led organizations — teams that
          live and work in the regions they serve. 87% of our partner
          organizations are locally run, and 94% of our project funding goes
          directly to operational aid. We don’t believe in “administrative black
          holes” where donations vanish into overhead — in fact, our operational
          costs are covered by private sponsors, so 100% of your donation goes
          to the cause. Our platform also features a Live Impact Dashboard,
          where you can follow real-time updates from the field. See how many
          water pumps have been installed this week in Malawi. Read how a
          micro-loan changed Fatima’s life in Morocco. Watch a short video from
          a community kitchen in Rio de Janeiro that you helped fund. We’re not
          just a middleman — we’re a movement. A movement for radical trust, for
          clarity, for people-powered change. Since 2021, over 132,000
          individuals have joined our mission, funding more than 2,800 projects
          across 38 countries. That’s over 1.2 million lives touched — and
          counting. We are Public Relief. Transparent. Accountable. Human.
          Because when the world feels uncertain, certainty in your compassion
          shouldn't be a luxury — it should be the standard.
